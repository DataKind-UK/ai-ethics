We explored Google’s dynamic explanations of bias and fairness.

### Description of the tool

_What is its purpose?_

Big ideas in machine learning, simply explained: The rapidly increasing usage of machine learning raises complicated questions: How can we tell if models are fair? Why do models make the predictions that they do? What are the privacy implications of feeding enormous amounts of data into models? This ongoing series of interactive, formula-free essays will walk you through these important concepts.

Hidden bias:

- college admissions use case: explains how models can improve with more information, but are affected by historical biases (e.g. women get lower grades than men). Hiding gender doesn’t prevent this - sometimes, it’s less discriminatory to take gender into account. If interviewers systematically overestimate men’s performance, this needs to be taken into account
  Measuring fairness:

- Medical diagnosis use case: do we optimize for “aggressive” prediction, preferring to misdiagnose (false positive) rather than miss a disease? What if the misdiagnosis rate varies across groups? Depends on whether the base rate is different, e.g. disease is more prevalent among children than adults.

-

Only looks at FP/FN trade-off, which is narrower than the fairness considerations (e.g. ethical)
_Who is the intended user?_

Non-technical business audience

_What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)?_

Explaining fairness issues

### Best for

What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?

- To explain different types of fairness to non-technical audience

### Pros & cons

What are the benefits of this tool?

- Easy to follow
  What are the challenges in using this tool?

- Domain-specific examples, hard to generalize

- not expandable to other use cases

- not very flexible - would be good to be able to e.g. include own numbers

- pushes you to use google tools

- doesn’t actually explain the underlying concepts - even though it looks very slick

### Limitations, especially any technical issues

No customization capabilities
