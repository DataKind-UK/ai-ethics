# [Can you make AI fairer than a judge? ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/17/75285/ai-fairer-than-judge-criminal-risk-assessment-algorithm/)

We reviewed MIT Technology Review’s interactive tool for explaining the tensions between different measures of ‘fairness’ in recidivism predictions.

### Overall evaluation

#### Technical Implementation

Useful: 5/5
Comprehensive: 5/5
Technical scalability: 3/5 (may be hard to access for non-technical, but easily re-purposed)
Easy to customize (data): n/a
Easy to customize (visualizations / analyses): n/a
Easy to integrate: n/a
Robustness: n/a

#### User-friendliness (system usability scale)

Answer with strongly agree (5), agree (4), neutral (3), disagree (2), strongly disagree (1)

Feel free to add comments and justifications!

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently: strongly agree

2. I found the system unnecessarily complex: disagree

3. I thought the system was easy to use: strongly agree

4. I think that I would need the support of a technical~~ ~~person to be able to use this system: disagree, although, could be enhanced

5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated: agree

6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system: disagree

7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly: agree

8. I found the system very cumbersome to use: disagree

9. I felt very confident using the system: agree

10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system: disagree

### Description of the tool

What is its purpose?

- An educational piece tool to illustrate the impact of ML within the legal system
- Brings to light the challenge in explaining “fairness”

Who is the intended user?

- Non technical & technical - anyone can understand it

What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)?

- Education, fairness in AI

### Best for:

What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?

- Understanding what is the impact of machine learning on society
- Might be particularly useful for policy makers and data scientists - brings to light a lot of nuances and challenges

### Pros & cons

What are the benefits of this tool?

- Understanding the challenge in the intersection between AI &lt;> Society

What are the challenges in using this tool?

- Can be a little intimidating for people who are less comfortable with numbers, it is more tailored for the average MIT tech reader, however if pulled apart, workshop style, would be incredibly useful

### Limitations, especially any technical issues

E.g. difficult to integrate or customize
