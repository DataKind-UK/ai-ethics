# In Practice

This guide, has been created by the DataKind community on a deep-dive day, where we all worked together to analyze and critique some of these tools. Of course, we by no means believe this is a exhaustive list, and would love to encourage the community to provide us with feedback and suggestions.

- **Challenge**: There has been an explosion of toolkits, packages, and software for fairness and explainability of algorithms. It is difficult to identify the right one to use.
- **Goal of the day**: Review the pros and cons of each toolkit and compile a “Practitioner’s Guide to Data Ethics Toolkits”
