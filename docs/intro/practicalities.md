# Priorities in an “ideal” toolkit

## Fairness

- Balance between comprehensiveness and usability / interpretability
- Adaptable to context-specific use cases
- UI: easier flow & examples / case studies to know what to look for
- Ease of integration / accessibility for technical packages (installation vs. Github)
- Variety of different fairness metrics
- Being able to comprehend different mitigation techniques and their pros & cons

## Explanation

- A layer for explainability on top of existing tools used, such as for both SciKit, Tensorflow - Closest is seldon.io Alibi 0.4.0
- There needs to be levels of explainability for both technical and business owners. DS can interpret tech into business,but we also need a wider schematic language to ensure transparency and that we think of ethics as a wider community

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Produce bias scores in standardised way
- Debias with different techniques
- Modeling framework agnostic
- Ability to explain predictions with different techniques

## Guidelines / checklists

- Comprehensive, stress tested
- Clear calls to action, clarity in next steps
- User friendly
- Supports an iterative process, not a ‘one-and-done’ approach

## Communicating ethics
