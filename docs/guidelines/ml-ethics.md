# [Machine Intelligence Ethics Framework](https://www.migarage.ai/ethics-framework/)

We evaluated Digital Catapult’s comprehensive set of questions aimed at early stage development in ML solutions

### Overall evaluation

#### Technical Implementation

Useful: 5/5 - but only for identification of issues, not solutions

Comprehensive: 5/5

Technical scalability: n/a

Easy to customize (data): n/a - might want to add guidance notes to help people answer the questions

Easy to customize (visualizations / analyses): n/a

Easy to integrate: 3/5

Robustness: 4/5

#### User-friendliness (system usability scale)

_Answer with strongly agree (5), agree (4), neutral (3), disagree (2), strongly disagree (1)_

_Feel free to add comments and justifications!_

9.

I felt very confident using the system:

10.

I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system:

### Description of the tool

_What is its purpose?_ - structured questions framework, designed to ‘out’ ethical issues

_Who is the intended user? _- individuals and organisations - in practice, designed for startups where all the decision-makers are in one room

\_What is its scope (algorithms, data, types of challenges)? \_services and products that use data and algorithms

### Best for:

_What should practitioners use this tool for? Are there any scenarios / use cases in which this tool is particularly helpful vs. useless?_

-

uncovering ethical issues

-

may not be useful if you don’t know the source of the data

### Pros & cons

_What are the benefits of this tool?_

-

spells out why these questions need answering
_What are the challenges in using this tool? _

-

doesn’t tell you how to fix the problems

-

not easy to tell when to think about which questions (at what stage of development process)

-

needs to be iterated and regularly reviewed as part of a process

### Limitations, especially any technical issues

_E.g. difficult to integrate or customize_

-

quite involved

### Case study demo with screenshots

_Add in screenshots with descriptions on data set used!_
